Let T be a binary search tree, in which each node consists of the information
NAME, SEX ('M' or 'F'), AGE and WEIGHT. Knowing that the tree was built with the
NAME and that there already exists a pointer named ROOT that points to the root node of the
tree, build algorithms for:
- Inform the number of men and the average age of the women;
- Search the age and weight of a particular person.

## Traversing a binary tree in preorder:
The pre-order route follows the knots until reaching the "deepest", in "branches"
from left subtrees to

- 1 Watch the root.
- 2 Traverse your left subtree in preorder.
- 3 Scroll through your right subtree in preorder.
